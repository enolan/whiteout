Whiteout is a Haskell BitTorrent library named in the proud tradition of
weather related BitTorrent software names. Okay, so there's actually only two,
but I think it's funny.

A note on building: this is broken with the version of iteratee currently on
Hackage. To try this out, you'll need to get the current darcs version and
apply this patch: http://gist.github.com/210453
